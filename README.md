# NPC Generator for Dungeons & Dragons 5e

Just in time for the next edition to release! I mean, maybe. As of writing this it's One D&D and who knows how long it will be before that becomes official.

Currently the generator is entirely random other than the height, weight, and age will generate on a standard distribution. This means that the character that gets built could be Fighter with constitution and strength as a dump stat.

## Future Plans

I have a small list of things I would like to add to this over time. This is a hobby project I took up to learn React as I am primarily an Angular developer. If anyone has ideas or feedback, feel free to reach out to me.

That small list I was talking about:

- SEO
- Add pictures that accurately represent the race, class, and gender
- Save generated NPCs to a cookie
- Download a pdf or print out NPC
